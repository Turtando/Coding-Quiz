# Code Quiz!


# Description 
For this repo, my objective was to create an informational quiz on Javascript that would allow a smooth user experience. To make it even more exciting, the quiz is presented with a 2-minute timer, allowing it to start as soon as the user begins his/her quiz. If the user is to answer the question incorrectly, they will also lose 20 seconds on their timer each time. If the user completes all 5 questions, or the timer runs out- the quiz is over.
